Mystiko is a Chrome extension designed to make passwords management easier.
It will automatically generate a unique and secure password for every website
and it is going to be different for each website that makes your passwords
more secure.

The main advantage of this tool is, it is stateless.
That means, there is no server behind this application which makes sure that our
passwords are never stored anywhere. It is calculated on the go.


This project was developed and designed by me, Navaneeth Chandrasekaran and some
of the resources I used to code the chrome extension and to deploy the project
are given below. I have used many websites to find out how to create a Chrome
extension and also for deploying the chrome extension.

I have also referred many examples and youtube videos to deploy my project, a
webpage for replacement of the chrome extension, in docker hub. Which was a
very challenging task.

Please find the references below for my list of major forums and resources
I referred for completing this project successfully.
